This project focuses on developing a machine learning model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect Parkinson's disease based on patient data. By utilizing a dataset that includes both individuals with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls, the project emphasizes accurate classification for early diagnosis. Key steps include data preprocessing—such as handling missing values and normalizing features—followed by training an SVM model, chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. Model performance is assessed through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Dependencies include Python, Jupyter Notebook, and libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. The notebook allows users to step through the data processing, model training, and evaluation, ultimately producing a reliable tool for predicting the likelihood of Parkinson's disease from new patient data, thus supporting clinicians in early disease detection and intervention.
